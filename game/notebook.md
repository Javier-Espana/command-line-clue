Detective's Initial Report:

During the morning roll call, The Artist reported odd footprints leading to the dock.

This seems like a good place to start our investigation. Remember to:
- Use 'cd' to move between locations
- Use 'ls' to list the contents of each location
- Use 'cat' to read any text files you find

New Clue:

Check the bakery in the shops.

Hint: You'll need to go back several directories to reach this location.
Remember that you can use multiple '../' to go up multiple levels:
- 'cd ..'    goes up one level
- 'cd ../..' goes up two levels
- and so on...
